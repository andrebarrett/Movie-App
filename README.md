# Movie-App
A simple MVP movie app to demonstrate fetching movie data from the movie database https://www.themoviedb.org/

This was put together in a short space of time and leaves a lot of room for improvement.
It uses basic MVC as a design architecture due to time constraints but has been developed to be flexible enough to adopt MVVM with ease.

There are some unit tests which demonstrate how testing can be achieved using dependency injection, protocols and mocking
